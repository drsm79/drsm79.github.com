## Intro

I delight in solving problems by working with innovative people & technology. I find solutions that are both creative and maintainable. During my career I've learnt how to work through people, recognising that an effective team is more productive than any single contributor. I relish finding team structures that are efficient & make the most of my team members skills.

I resolve problems with a balance of collecting data and intuition & judgement, and recognise a solution may be technical, non-technical, or a mix of both. I enjoy working with large systems, and like identifying ways to simplify them; through either technical, procedural or organisational changes.

Innovative manager experienced in running distributed teams of highly-skilled engineers and project managers.
