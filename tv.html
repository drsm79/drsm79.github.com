        <h5>The screen</h5>
        <p>Most importantly the screen is exceptional. It's incredibly crisp, fast
        to update and very beautiful to look at. The factory setting is actually
        too good - watching TV shows that aren't UHD ready, or even recent films
        in HD you really see where effects or scenery come in, making suspension
        of disbelief hard. Luckily you can easily tweak the settings back to
        something "softer".</p>

        <h5>FirefoxOS</h5>

        <h5>The apps</h5>
        <p>When we got the TV home the app selection was pretty poor. Before getting
        a smart TV we had our decent screen hooked up to a computer, so were used
        to having Netflix, Amazon Prime as well as iPlayer &amp; other UK catch
        up services available. We got the TV a day after it launched so the apps
        available were pretty poor, and the only streaming service available was
        Netflix. Panasonic didn't have a timeline for the apps being made available
        but they did respond on twitter.</p>
