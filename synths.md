title: These are my synths
layout: post
---

A while back I saw a video of [Adrian Utley playing an Arturia MiniBrute][1]. For some reason it really resonated with me, and I ended up buying one. I have to admit, that was the start of an addiction. I now have a small (but growing) army of synths.

There are a few things that attract me to synths. I like a lot of music that is [very][2] [synth][3] [heavy][4], I enjoy making electronic music, I've been trying to use computers less in my outside of work life, and they're things you can [build yourself][5].
