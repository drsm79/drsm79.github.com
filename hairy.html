	<h1>Hairy</h1>
	<p>I'm planning to <a href="https://bravetheshave.org.uk/">brave the
		shave</a> this year. Those who know and love me know that I've got a
		lot of hair, so this is a big deal (but no where near as big a deal for
		people who have to do it for real). I want to get some serious cash for 
		Macmillan. Given the ammount of hair I've got, and how cruel some of my 
		friends are, I'm planning a kickstarter-esque approach to get the money
		rolling in.</p>

	<h2>£500</h2>
	<p>The hair's gone. Bic'ed. Bald as a coot.</p>
	<h2>£750</h2>
	<p>Where's the beard? The beard is gone too - the humanity!</p>
	<h2>£1000</h2>
	<p>Leg hair? What leg hair?</p>
	<h2>£1000+</h2>
	<p>Open to suggestions, the only thing that's out of bounds are the 
		eyebrows...</p>
