This week I've made not one but two Twitch appearances with [Matt](https://twitter.com/hammertoe). The first was starting to code up a ML/AI to [identify synth modules](https://dev.to/hammertoe/using-machine-learning-to-catalog-modular-synthesizers-co2). The idea for this came to me when I thought about updating my [modulargrid](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/users/view/77246) page & realised I've got enough bits & pieces that it would be a chore. I'm lazy & we live in the future, so surely a robot could do it for me!

Well, one can't, yet, but Matt & I will be making one over the coming weeks. So far we've got the tooling to make a training dataset (you can see the code [here](https://github.com/drsm79/modulair/)). We'd planned to use a tool that was down at the time of recording, so hastily had to rethink our approach, which led to some mildly panicked coding behind the scenes. I think Matt covered it excellently, though, and did a good job of turning a problem in to a way to explain things to the audience.

The second appearance happened this morning. Matt spotted a [GitHub hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-github-actions-hackathon-on-dev-3ljn) which our [previous]({% post_url 2020-07-01-PayID-Functions-Twitch %}) [twitchings]({% post_url 2020-07-03-PayID-Functions-Twitch-part-2 %}) seemed like a good starting point to build upon. I could only join for the first 30 mins (real life got in the way) but when I dropped we had the bare bones of the action set up and I left Matt to "draw the rest of the owl". Which he duly did.

I have to say, he seems very surprised that it works! ;)
