<h4 class="mdl-typography--headline">First of all, <b>thank you</b> everyone who donated!</h4>

The big day came around and after raising over &pound;2395 I set
forth with razors, clippers and scissors (big seamstress ones...) on a
gruelling 7 razor, 5 hour shaving marathon. 

Don't worry if you've not had a chance to doante yet, donations are
still being taken on my <a href="https://bravetheshave.org.uk/shavers/simon-metson/">Brave the Shave page</a>, so be cool like all the other kids and give
generously!

We had a BBQ for people who'd sponsored to witness the removal. For
    those of you who couldn't make it; fear not (or maybe fear more...);
    Chloe made a micro documentary*!

To make the most of the sheared head hair was donated to <a href="http://www.littleprincesses.org.uk/">the Little Princess Trust</a>.

in such high definition, I'd maybe have hit the gym and stayed off the
cheese for a few weeks prior...</small>
