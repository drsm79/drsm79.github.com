Early days yet, but over Christmas I started https://bomhub.github.io with someone in France. The idea is that it becomes a collection of sdiy BOM's and some "crowd sourced" build guides. Very early stages yet, but I think it could be useful. I'd like to get to a  point where it rendered actual BOMs, as opposed to linking out to them, and was able to search over them to  identify common components between projects ("I'm building a Rot8, what could I over order to build a Jove?"). It would also be really neat if it could fire those into Octopart or similar, such that you can buy a nice load of electronics in one easy step.
