Last year I won a competition as part of [Machina Bristronica](https://www.factmag.com/2019/01/29/machina-bristronica-2019-synth-expo-final-lineup/). The prize was to have a few tracks mastered & lathe cut to vinyl by [Bladud Flies!](http://bladudflies.com/) - definitely very cool having them on (clear!) vinyl. Limited to only 5 copies, given to friends & family for Christmas/birthdays.

This is the track that actually won, the other two I chose, mainly down to them being current & not terrible. It was improvised in one take on the modular, and if I remember right was doing some clever things with the [sampleslicer]({% post_url 2020-07-08-sampleslicer %}) with the [RadioMusic](https://musicthing.co.uk/pages/radio.html) making an appearnce to close out the track.
