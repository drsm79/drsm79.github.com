This is a song of many firsts. Its the first song [my dad](https://www.chrisfoster-iceland.com/) has written (he normally performs/records arrangements of traditional English folk songs, and lots of [Leon Rosselson](https://www.leonrosselson.co.uk/)). It's the first time I've sung on one of his records. Its the first time Lib has ever been on record.

Our bits & a few others were recorded in my "studio" upstairs, which was sort of inspiring, while my father-in-laws 60th birthday party raged downstairs. Was a funny day.

The album got good reviews (my uncle thinks it's his best...) and one song was nominated for "Best Traditional Track" at the [BBC 2 Folk Awards](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/ZkWmhJY7WBxLNZbRp65V1S/nominees). You should [check it out](https://chrisfoster1.bandcamp.com/album/hadelin).

It's good to be alive!
