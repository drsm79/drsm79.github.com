Last year I won a competition as part of [Machina Bristronica](https://www.factmag.com/2019/01/29/machina-bristronica-2019-synth-expo-final-lineup/). The prize was to have a few tracks mastered & lathe cut to vinyl by [Bladud Flies!](http://bladudflies.com/) - definitely very cool having them on (clear!) vinyl. Limited to only 5 copies, given to friends & family for Christmas/birthdays.

This one is just a bit of a roller.

The cover image comes from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/jFu29QqO2yg) & was the first image that came up when I searched for "Better". It is part of the United Nations COVID-19 Response, which seems timely & appropriate.
