summary: I may have a problem...
---

Partly due to [recording with Anechoics](https://anechoics.uk/recordings/2020/10/11/Album.html) and partly due to lockdown boredoms I've been updating my [modular grid](https://www.modulargrid.net/) entries. I'm starting to admit that I possibly have a problem... It's so bad that I've added a Jekyll include especially for modular grid images. Winning!

In general I've tried to make the racks be independently useful/complete. They'll have control modules (sequencers, switches, clocks...) and voice modules (VCO's, VCA's, envelope generators) that they could be used on their own, or linked up to make something larger.

## Little guy

Built in my first case from Pittsburgh modular, this has housed my Metropolis for almost forever.

## Hack rack voices 1

Built in a [box from Ikea](https://anechoics.uk/gear/2020/05/17/Second-mini-gig-rig.html) I've enjoyed building these "hack racks", to the point of doing it for fun... Lots of different VCO's in here, but they kind of make sense together, especially the two [Doepfer A-110-4 SE](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/doepfer-a-110-4-se), which I use to FM one another. Filthy.

## Hack rack voices 2

This one is still a WIP - I need to finish the uO_C -  and it's a bit of a weird rack. Kind of for drones, loops, and other weirdness, but with a really nice VCO at it's centre (the TÅ¡-L v2).

## Hack rack brains

This was called "brains" when it had a few more logic and sequencer modules in, but the name has stuck. That said, it has two very nice, and slightly unusual sequencers in (the [Antumbra Rot8](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/antumbra-rot8) and the [Division 6](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/division-6-dual-mini-sequencer)). While its not got a lot of voices in, the [Sloth](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/nonlinearcircuits-sloth-chaos-4hp) & [WPO](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/dove-audio-waveplane-oscillator) is probably one of my favourite voice combos. The blank panels are actually a [switched mult](https://www.etsy.com/listing/890304003/beepboop-eurorack-switched-multiple) and a [Tape Sampler](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/876369994/eurorack-tape-sampler-prebuilt-old-stock) from my friend Jack.

## Big guy

This is my biggest synth, which is sort of a problem. It's so big that I don't use it enough - it probably needs a rethink. It's built out of recycled parquet flooring that I got from the [Bristol Wood Recycling Project](https://www.bwrp.org.uk/) (a happy place...) which is a sort of a great & sort of terrible material to build a synth from. It also lacks finesse as I lack a workshop.

## My Unsafe Eurorack

Built in a Thomann rack enclosure, this was the first case I wired up with a Meanwell PSU. It's got some of my favourite modules (Rampage, Ryk M-185, Sampleslicer) in and probably more [buffered mults](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/other-unknown-double-buff) than it needs.
