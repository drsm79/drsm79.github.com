I think this was our first gig at EMOM, but I might be misremembering - if not it's the second. I do remember it was hot, but not as hot as now. Recorded off the desk, then put through a [mastering plugin](https://klevgrand.se/products/grandfinale) I like to bring out some of the parts a bit better.

You can watch the performance on [our webpage](https://anechoics.uk/performance/2019/07/12/Greenbank-EMOM.html), as much as two men nodding over some synths can be described as a performance, if you're into such things.
