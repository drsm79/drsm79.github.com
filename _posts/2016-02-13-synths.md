A while back I saw a video of [Adrian Utley playing an Arturia MiniBrute][1]. For some reason it really resonated with me, and I ended up buying one. I have to admit, that was the start of an addiction. I now have a small (but growing) army of synths.

There are a few things that attract me to synths. I like a lot of music that is [very][2] [synth][3] [heavy][4], I enjoy making electronic music, I've been trying to use computers less in my outside of work life, and they're things you can [build yourself][5]. Thinking about synths more, they're the only instrument that's both of the past and the future. They send you back in time to the 70's and 80's but then through you forward into some futuristic sci-fi world that's not yet come to pass.

Current kit list looks like: 

 * My modular [Rustic synth][6] 
 * The [Little Guy][7]
 * Waldorf Streichfett
 * Arturia minibrute
 * Arturia microbrute
 * White and Black Meeblip
 * Dreadbox Erebus (love)
 * Novation MoroderNova
 * Akai MPC 2000XL
 * Akai Rhythm Wolf
 * Korg Volca Beats
 * Korg Volca Bass
 * Korg Volca Sample
 * Korg Monotron Delay
 * Korg SQ-1
 * Gakken S-150

Should you ever find yourself wondering what to get me for Christmas, may I draw your attention to [my synth wishlist][8]
