By accident I ended up with three PCB's for the Non-Linear Circuits [Triad module](https://www.nonlinearcircuits.com/modules/triad). So I decided to put them into one mega TriADADAD module.

The panel is just some snazzy purple perspex I had. I made a little mod, so that a trigger passes through all three modules (the little yellow wires below).

It's a bit silly & a bit fun.
