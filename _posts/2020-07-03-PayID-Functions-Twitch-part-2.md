Part two pulled together all the things into a working demo, Matt is indeed a big spender! Even the docker gods smiled on us...

Reflecting a bit on the experience, it was a really good way to write some software. Weirdly, having an audience made getting into the coding "flow" easier. I guess because you were aware of other peoples needs & time you didn't go down rabbit warrens or bike shed, and were (more) conscious of keeping code explainable & concise. It also gave me an opportunity to try out some things I'd not normally get around to (VS Code Sharing is super sweet, IBM Cloud Functions are neat). So, all in all, a good way to spend a quiet Friday afternoon :).

**Updated:** Matt wrote up his take (and rewrote the whole thing) in his [DEV blog](https://dev.to/hammertoe/using-ibm-cloud-functions-for-github-hooks-3md7).
