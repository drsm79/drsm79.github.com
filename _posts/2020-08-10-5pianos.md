Last year I won a competition as part of [Machina Bristronica](https://www.factmag.com/2019/01/29/machina-bristronica-2019-synth-expo-final-lineup/). The prize was to have a few tracks mastered & lathe cut to vinyl by [Bladud Flies!](http://bladudflies.com/) - definitely very cool having them on (clear!) vinyl. Limited to only 5 copies, given to friends & family for Christmas/birthdays.

This was written, I think, after watching a [BBC documentary on minimalism](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09tbh10) which I enjoyed. The idea was to make a "rules based" piece of music (acknowledging that rules are sometimes made to be broken...) in a Reich/Riley stylee (which would have been a better name). There are, unsurprisingly, 5 different piano's going here, all using the [Arturia Piano V2](https://www.arturia.com/products/analog-classics/piano-v/overview) with each one being different models & slightly tweaked rooms to give it some more interest for your subconscious to hook into.
