    <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--8-col"><p>I've been thinking, off and on,
      about doing less stuff online, or rather, online activities being a part
      of something larger, rather than an end in themselves. I like twitter,
      facebook etc. but I also like listening to records, playing music, making
      marble runs and riding my bike. One set of things I'm putting a lot of
      time into, the others not so much. So, the plan is to use January as a
      time to go offline a bit more.</p>
      <p>A lot of why these things pull me in is how accessible they are - it's
      basically a NoOp to open the iPhone or iPad and check on them. At the
      same time there's a lot online that's good and useful, I'd not want to be
      cut off completely. Even checking on Facebook occasionally isn't a bad
      thing per se, but I'd like to make it harder, so that it's not the
      default thing to do when at a loose end.</p>
      <p>So, rather than cut the network cables and power off the wifi router I
      plan to restrict my time on the iDevices. This is going to be tricky -
      the iPhone is basically the family camera, the iPad is how I listen to
      Spotify - but I'll work something out.</p>
